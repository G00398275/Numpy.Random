    "## Aim\n",
    "The aim of this Jupyter notebook is to explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package in Python. This notebook will provide an explanation of the overall purpose of the numpy.random package. The \"Simple Random Data\" and \"Permutations\" functions will be explained with coded examples and plots. In addition five \"Distributions\" functions will be explained. The five distributions to be covered are Uniform, Normal, Logistic, Poisson, and, Gamma. Also, the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers will be discussed with coding and plotting examples for clear explanations."

    "## Overall Purpose\n",
    "The overall purpose of the numpy.random package in Python is to generate pseudorandom numbers based on different mathematical functions. These pseudo random numbers can subsequently be used to perform a wide variety of statistical analyses and operations on numerical data such as sorting, basic linear algebra, random simulation etc. [1]  \n",
    "Numpy stands for 'Numerical Python'. Travis Oliphant, an American data scientist, (along with other contributors) created Numpy in 2005 [2] as more modern replacement, suitable for newer programming languages, for Matlab.  \n",
    "As previously stated there are a wide variety of mathematical functions that can be performed using Numpy. For the purposes of this notebook the specific function covered here will be the numpy.random package. The generation of pseudorandom numbers or data has a large number of real world applications such as computer games development, online gambling games, crytography (such as password generation) to name a few. In these cases it is crucial that the numbers generated are truely random (or appear to be so) so that, for example, hackers could not guess a password, or defraud an online gambling website.  \n",
    "![](https://troymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/slots650.jpg)  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for data to be generated randomly (or appear to be generated randomly) a computer needs a procedure to do so that is not evident to an end user. For example, if a hacker was trying to decrpyt a password randomly generated to break into a website / e mail inbox / online bank account etc. the encryption method needs to hidden from the end user. If the hacker was aware of the procedure that the machine used to generate these pseudorandom numbers then it is possible they could replicate the password by copying what the computer is doing.  \n",
    "Consequently, the procedure used by the computer to generate this random data needs to be highly effective and extremely difficult to replicate. The method used by numpy.random to \"seed\" this random data is PCG64 (Permuted Congruential Generator - 64bit). This will be discussed further in the section on \"Seeds\" in this notebook.  \n",
    "Another use of this psuedorandom data is in the creation of statistcial models in data analytics. These randomly created statistical models (based on certain mathematical functions) can be used for the purposes of investigating real world data with great effect.[3]  \n",
